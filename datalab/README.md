### When i want to judge two number whether is it equal ?

> Use **Xor**
> Judging `x` is equal to `y`, which is equivalent to judge `!(x ^ y)`

### When i want to change not-zero number into Zero or zero number into One ?

> Use LogicNeg `!`
> if `x` is **not-zero**, `!x` will transfrom it into **Zero**
> if `x` is **zero**, `!x` will transfrom it into **One**
